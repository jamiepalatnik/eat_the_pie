# Eat the Pie
Pairing practice at the Recurse Center.

Play a non-violent version of hangman in the terminal! Choose your difficulty level, enjoy pie chart visuals, and guess letters until you guess the secret word or run out of pie.

## How to get started
We use `uv` for package management. You can install it with `brew install uv` if you don't have it already.

Once you have `uv`:
1. `cd` to the directory you have this downloaded to.
2. `uv venv`
3. `uv pip sync pyproject.toml`
4. `uv run python eat_the_pie.py`
